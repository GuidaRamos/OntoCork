# OntoCork
OntoCork is a micro domain-ontology of cork stoppers. These manufactured objects are considered the backbone of the Portuguese industry of cork.

The purpose of this domain-ontology is primarily to organise concepts denoting the real-world object designated by the term “cork stopper”, in a systematic way, depending on the type of substance the object is made of, its function, shape and parts. The substance the object is made of plays a central role: concepts are hierarchically systematised according to their composition, in the sense of substance (raw material). The ultimate purpose of the ontology is to organise the operations intervening in the manufacturing process of the objects – the “cork stoppers” – depending on the purpose of each operation in order to obtain a classification of each object. Finally, this classification aims at providing information on the manufacturing stage of the object regarding its stage of completion within the manufacturing process. 

This project stems from the organisation of knowledge in the specialised field of cork, which is at the core of our study. For that purpose, a terminological knowledge database (TKB) is being developed to feed an e-dictionary. This e-dictionary is designed as a multilingual and multimodal product, where several resources, namely linguistic and conceptual ones are paired to facilitate knowledge acquisition by the user.

OntoCork is being developed in OWL. The formal definitions are inferred from CorkCorpus - a specialised corpus built from scratch.
