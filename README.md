# OntoCork
OntoCork is a micro domain-ontology of cork stoppers according to their structure, substance, function, shape and finishing treatments, within the scope of the transformation sector in the industry of cork. 

 This ontology seeks to respond to two typologies: 
(1) the type of cork stopper compared to the type of cork (raw material) with which it is produced; and
(2) the typology of operations that belong to the finishing processes.
Finally, this ontology should also respond to the state of completion – in the sense of finished product – of the cork stopper, depending on the last operation to which it was submitted.

OntoCork is developped in OWL.
